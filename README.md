## Running the project

If you prefer `yarn` you can run the following in the project directory:

```python
yarn           # Install dependencies
yarn dev       # Run app in development mode
yarn test      # Start Jest test runner - press `a` to run all tests
# To run a production build:
yarn build
yarn start
```

If you prefer `npm` you can run the following in the project directory:

```python
npm install    # Install dependencies
npm run dev    # Run app in development mode
npm test       # Start Jest test runner - press `a` to run all tests
# To run a production build:
npm run build
npm start
```

The application will be running at: http://localhost:3000

## Testing approach

```bash
npm test      # Test runner - press `a` to run all tests
yarn test     # Test runner - press `a` to run all tests
```
